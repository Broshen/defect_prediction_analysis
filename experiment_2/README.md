## File Descriptions

/generate_gobnilp_graphs.py - runs GOBNILP on all datasets in a folder, with settings specified by `gobnilp.set`, and outputs the results to bn_graphs. The input folder, output folder, GOBNILP executable path, and settings file path are all variables that can be set within the script.

/aggregate_graph_data.py - combines the resulting BNs in ./bn_graphs, by counting how many times each edge appears in all graphs, into an aggregate graph in ./results

/gobnilp.set - settings file for GOBNILP - defines settings such as number of top BNs to generate, computation time limit, output format, etc.

/bn_graphs - folder where the resulting .dot files generated by GOBNILP are saved to

/results - the results of the analysis performed by aggregate_graph_data.py

To run the experiment, first run `python generate_gobnilp_graphs.py`, then `python aggregate_graph_data.py`. Results will be found in /results.
