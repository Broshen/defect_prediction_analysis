TODOLIST:

June 3rd
-generate top 100 BNs for a specific dataset, aggregate that
	- make sure all BNs have a similar score, otherwise discard
-try to treat edges as undirected (for experiment_1 and experiment_2) see if that simplifies the aggregated structure
-proper discretization (instead of quartiling) all data columns
-investigate combining various datasets (e.g. all of the ECLIPSEX_BURSTX_GAPX) into a single dataset by adding additional variables that capture the differences

May 27th, May 23rd
run & generate from different datasets, see if patterns persists in graphs - experiment_1
run & generate suboptimal graphs, see if persists in graphs - experiment_2

investigate getting weights onto edges
investigate using conditional probability values as weights (instead of the ones generated by GOBNILP)
investigate ways to measure how similar graphs are, software to pick out patterns in multiple graphs
investigate using weka to preprocess and optimally discretize data
play around with variations on columns to include/exclude, classes vs packages
try GOBNILP with different scoring metrics (BIC vs BDM)
read up about conditional independence assumptions
